Nifty Assignment --- Creating an ERC20 token
=======================

| Attribute | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Summary | Create a basic smart contract on an Ethereum test network while going over every method of implementation of the ERC20 specification  |
| Topics  | Solidity programming, blockchain development  |
| Audience | Appropriate for CS1 or a later course. |
| Difficulty | Completing the assignment is easy, as it is just editing a contract and deploying it. However, full understanding and extension of the contract can be difficult. |
| Strengths | The strength of this assignment is that it allows students to get exposed to technology that they hear about all the time (blockchain) and creates a seed of learning that they can research further. |
| Weaknesses | It may be difficult for students to extend their first smart contract. They might require more in-depth knowledge about how transactions work in blockchain settings. | 
| Dependencies | Requires the understanding of implementing interfaces in an object-oriented language. It also requires the understanding of blockchain transactions in order to further extend past the assignment. |
| Variants | Could be used in an introductory course of OOP languages, as means to introduce how to implement a specification. |
